## Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment — Summary

### Objective
The objective of this analysis was to understand how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs Greed)
affects trader behavior and performance on the Hyperliquid platform, and to derive
actionable insights that could inform smarter trading decisions.

### Data & Approach
Two datasets were used: the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index and historical trade-level data from
Hyperliquid. Both datasets were cleaned, validated, and aligned at a daily level.
Key performance and behavioral metrics such as PnL, win rate, trade frequency, and
position size were engineered and analyzed across sentiment regimes.

### Key Insights
1. **Performance Differences**  
   Greed days tend to show higher average PnL but also higher variability, indicating
   increased risk-taking behavior compared to Fear days.

2. **Behavioral Shifts**  
   Traders generally reduce trade frequency during Fear days but increase position sizes,
   suggesting more selective yet aggressive trades under negative sentiment.

3. **Trader Segmentation**  
   High-exposure traders underperform during Fear regimes, while lower-exposure and
   less frequent traders show more stable outcomes across sentiment conditions.

### Strategy Recommendations
1. **Risk Control During Fear**  
   Reduce position sizes or exposure during Fear days, especially for high-exposure traders,
   to limit drawdowns and improve risk-adjusted performance.

2. **Selective Aggression During Greed**  
   Enable higher trade frequency strategies primarily during Greed periods, where win rates
   and overall performance are stronger.

### Conclusion
Market sentiment has a measurable impact on both trader behavior and performance.
Incorporating sentiment-aware rules into trading strategies can help improve outcomes
and manage risk more effectively.
